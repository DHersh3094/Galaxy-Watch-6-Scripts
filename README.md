## Daily_HeartRate_GalaxyWatch6.py
#### A quick script to plot continuous heart rate measurements from the Galaxy watch 6 along with exercise data
- Input "filedir" is the jsons folder downloaded from the Samsung Health app ("Download Personal Data")
- Output "outdir" is where the plots are save
    - One file for each day of data

#### Example output:
![Example plot](https://github.com/DHersh3094/Galaxy-Watch-6-Scripts/blob/main/February%2005%2C%202024_heart_rate.png)https://github.com/DHersh3094/Galaxy-Watch-6-Scripts/blob/main/February%2005%2C%202024_heart_rate.png)

### To do:
- Fix areas of workouts to either have 1 value per minute (plot vlines) or shade between continuous data
- Add sleep times
- Take input folder of the main folder from "Download Personal Data", not the subfolder "jsons"
